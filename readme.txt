My First Time Rendering a Donut with Python || Irom ||
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a project I have done for practicing rendering with python.

This is my first time rendering with python so it wont be as smooth as you think it would be.
Its going on 0.0000311 and 0.0000225 of rotation speed so it is almost smooth but not enought entirely.
list of numbers used in this project: "0" and "1" in a 12 digit sequence.
You will need 3.19 python version to run this or even higher.

If you want to support my github it is Irom-codesJavaS:
